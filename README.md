### 💬 About me

I'm passionate about many creative pursuits, including drawings, music, videography, building FPV racing drones, and of course, coding. I spend the most of my time developing websites and reading documentations about the newest technologies around software. I love the fact that anyone can build anything without asking for permission. I find the open source community very interesting. It is diverse and highly motivated. Whether it's development or advocacy, open source software and other collaborative projects benefit through, and because of, **the community**.

### 🔭 Current project

I am currently maintaining [a mobile Cashu wallet for Android and iOS](https://github.com/cashubtc/eNuts). Cashu is an Ecash implementation based on David Wagner's variant of Chaumian blinding. The token logic is based on [minicash](https://github.com/phyro/minicash) ([description](https://gist.github.com/phyro/935badc682057f418842c72961cf096c)) which implements a [Blind Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange](https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1996/03/msg01848.html) scheme written down [here](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/be7a4760dd4596d06963d67baf140406).
